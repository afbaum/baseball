# For my project I am using data to determine which baseball team is better, the Cardinals or the Cubs.  The Cubs and the Cardinals 
have a very long standing rivaly such that the price of tickets are higher when those two teams are playing eachother.  I am wondering 
if one team is actually better than the other or if the rivalry is becasue the teams are well matched.  

I used data from Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database at http://www.seanlahman.com.  This database contains MLB baseball data dating back to 1871.  
this data includes information on wins and loss, World Series wins, pitching statistics and batting statistics by team.  
I hope to use this information to determine which team is better.  

This is a python 3 program created useing jupyter notebook.
